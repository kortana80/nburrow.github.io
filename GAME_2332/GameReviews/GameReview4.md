# Game Review

# Details
* Game Title: Wario's Woods
* Developer: Nintendo
* Year: 1994

# Summary: 

This game was developed by Nintendo in 1994 and was the last licenced Nintendo game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and it was also made for the Super Nintendo.  The version I played was the original NES version, and Wario is back to his ways by taking over the animals and Toad needs to clear them out to end the spell.

# Final Thoughts:

Since this game was developed late in the lifecycle of the original Nintendo, I did not play it when it had originally came out.  Playing it now, brought back a feeling of nostalgia while still being fresh and new.  It's takes the idea of Tetris and makes it's own.  I believe if this game came out earlier, around the time of Dr. Mario and the original Tetris, it would have been better remembered, as this game is both addictive and fun to play.
