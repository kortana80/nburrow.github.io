# Final Thoughts

The game is only available to play in unpopular internet browsers, Internet Explorer and Safari.  In order to play you you would need to search for the Unity Web Player to play.  After downloading the plugin and restarting the browser the game loaded fine.  While at first, the actual respawn machine was the most unique and fun part of the game, quickly became the most frustrating aspect. For example, if you were to mess up and throw the respawn machine somewhere you didn't want it (even it was on the ground in front of you, which you can't pick back up), you would need to find a way to kill yourself to try again.  This could have been fixed by changing the respawn machine into a teleportation one that would respawn back in your hands with a press of a button. Also, The puzzles weren't hard to figure out but hard to do, for example you have to throw the respawn machine on top of the watertower which required an exact angle, and took a too many tries to successfully pull off.  With that said, this game can be fun at times, but needs a bit more work.
