## Heroku Continuous Integration Testing Options

After researching Heroku’s website, there is many different testing options that Heroku CI has available for testing.  The most important thing is it supports many of the popular programming languages, like node.js, PHP, Java, and Python to name a few since it gives the test versatility.  It is a good way to run unit, negative and integration testing since it can test the code directly in these languages. An example of automation testing is that you can run test to your GitHub repositories and deploy new versions of your application automatically through Heroku.  You can also debug which is a great way to test its functions.  Heroku CI has compatibility testing and performance testing since it allows you to test stable, beta, and unstable releases of Google Chrome. 

You can use an application called Pipelines that Heroku uses, which is good for gaming since it continuously tests the different test environments, development, QA, staging and production.  This is helpful because it is automatically deployed, and it allows developers to test the change, when it’s ready it is merged altogether, then it’s automatically deployed for further testing.  When the developer is ready they can put in from staging to production making available to the end user.  I can use this to test the code continually throughout all the different testing environments.
