## Game Testing Concepts Assignment

After watching the videos about the testing process and I found it very interesting.  For the first question, I believe you really have to have an eye for detail and have patience. When playing the game, you have to make sure that everything looks right especially after a change in the code. You have to be very patient since you will have to do the same action over and over again to try and break the game. Which brings me to the answer to my second question, I believe the hardest thing about being a tester is the process can be very tedious, since you may spend days are even weeks doing the same exact actions day in and day out.  In regards to the last question, I learned from the video that the testing process actually is much longer then I initially thought it was.  In my mind the game was mostly developed then the testers came in about 6 months to maybe a year prior to launch, but in reality they are testing for several years.
