# Final Thoughts 

When you start the game, you are greeted with several loading screens which take several minutes each.  You are a flying device collecting relics and the story is a bit convoluted and somewhat hard to follow.  The controls take a bit to get used, but it becomes ok after you get used to it.  I also found it boring boring to play and lost interest in it very quickly.  There was a point where I turned in a relic and the game didn't react or do anything, and I thought it was loading.  There was no dialog on what to do next, I eventually started pressing buttons and a menu came up.  Pressed LB and finally I was playing again, and there was nothing saying that I needed to do this.  With all of this said, the game has a unique artstyle to it that can sometimes be nice to look at.  Sadly graphics never make a game good, the gameplay does, and the gameplay is lacking quite a bit.  I would pass on this one and give it a slightly below average score of 4/10.
