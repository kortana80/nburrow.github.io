# Final Thoughts
The game starts off with a still frame cutscene explaining the Nikolai wanting to steal an artifact.  While this cutscene gets the point across it's very dull and kind of boring. After the game starts, it reminds me of older stealth games of sneaking and hiding as guards walk by something between Metal Gear and a 2D version of Splinter Cell.  It suprisingly works and started to draw me in dispite the opening cut scene.  There were no long loading or visual bugs that I saw. I did have a time where I stood in front of a guard and he saw me.  I went to the side right by were I was and he continued on, instead of looking for me.  Overall, for being a spin-off of the main Assasin's Creed story line it is pretty good, but could have stood alone and maybe even been better if it were it's own IP.
